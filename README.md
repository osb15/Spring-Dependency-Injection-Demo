# Employee Management System

A comprehensive Employee Management System built using Spring Framework. This project demonstrates efficient handling of employee data with proper dependency injection and annotation-based configuration.

## Features
- **Employee Details Management**: Easily manage employee information such as ID, name, and associated country.
- **Country Association**: Integrates country-specific details, including country codes and names.
- **Spring Dependency Injection**: Leverages Spring's annotation-based DI for seamless object management.
- **Component Scanning**: Fully configured Spring application using `@ComponentScan`.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Framework
- **Dependency Injection**: Spring Annotations
- **Configuration**: Annotation-based Configuration

## Project Structure
- **Entities**: Represents the core components (`Employee`, `Country`).
- **Main**: Contains the entry point and configuration files.
- **Configuration**: Fully annotation-driven Spring configuration for ease of setup.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Ensure all required dependencies are configured in your project (Spring Context, Spring Core).
4. Run the `Controller` class as a Java application.
5. Observe the console for the output showcasing dependency injection in action.

## Key Learning Points
- Understanding of Spring Framework and its capabilities.
- Practical use of `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Value` annotations.
- Configuring and managing Spring applications without XML.
